# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 challenge. I implore you to refrain from mocking the
inefficiency of my code :) but will absolutely welcome any improvements through pull requests.

This project is written in Python 3 and it is recommended that you run the individual puzzle files in their directory so
that the dependencies with previous puzzles are found as well as allowing the programs to find the custom input text
which is unique to the user.

For those of you who are trying to test my algorithms with custom inputs, simply put your custom input text in the input
files to see what happens. Learners who want to see how my code works or may function better than theirs are welcome.
Cheaters, on the other hand, are not. If you fit into the latter demographic, GO AWAY!
